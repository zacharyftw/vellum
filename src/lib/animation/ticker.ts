 * nothing. Each subscriber is throttled independently by its own framerate.

 * `requestAnimationFrame` timestamps jitter either side of the display's period:
 * a 60 Hz panel delivers 16.4 ms, 16.9 ms, 16.6 ms, not a clean 16.67 ms. A
 * subscriber asking for 60 fps has an interval of 16.667 ms, so a strict
 * `elapsed <= interval` test **rejects every frame that arrives a fraction
 * early** — and because a rejected frame does not advance `last`, the next one is
 * measured across a double gap and always passes. The subscriber settles into an
 * alternating render / skip pattern: ~40 fps with 16.7 / 33 ms gaps, which the
 * eye reads as stutter rather than as a lower frame rate.
 *
 * One millisecond of slack absorbs the jitter. It is far below the 16.7 ms
 * spacing of the next real frame, so it cannot let a 30 fps subscriber sneak an
 * extra frame through — it only stops the gate from rejecting frames it meant to
 * accept.
