/**
 * The site's interaction language — how every button, link and row answers a
 * pointer.
 *
 * Three states, layered: `hover` merges over `rest`, and `press` merges over both.
 * So a preset only declares what actually changes.
 *
 * **No scale, anywhere.** A control that grows under the cursor is a tell that the
 * motion was added for its own sake. These respond in colour and weight instead:
 * the surface takes light, the border firms up, the ink shifts to the accent. The
 * box never moves, so nothing reflows.
 *
 * ## Why the colours are literals here, not `var(--token)`
 * react-spring animates a colour by interpolating its channels, which it can only
 * do between two *parsed* colours. `var(--chalk)` is an opaque string to it, so a
 * spring between two custom properties does not animate — it snaps on the first
 * frame, which is exactly the CSS-transition-shaped result the project bans.
 *
 * These are values an *interpolator* consumes rather than styles a stylesheet
 * resolves. **Keep them in step with the tokens in `globals.css`.**
